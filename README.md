# ENPM661 Project 3 Phase 1: Implementation of the A* Algorithm for a Point Robot
---

This project implements a pathfinding algorithm using A* algorithm in a 2D environment with obstacles. The environment is represented as an image where obstacles are marked in black and free space is white.

The action set consists of 5 different moves:
- Turn 0 (Moves the Robot forward)
- Turn 30 (Moves the Robot Up by 30 Degrees)
- Turn 60 (Moves the Robot Up by 30 Degrees)
- Turn N30 (Moves the Robot down by 30 Degrees)
- Turn N60 (Moves the Robot down 60 Degrees )
